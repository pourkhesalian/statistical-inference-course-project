## Overview
One of the standard learning data sets included in R is the “ToothGrowth” data set. The tooth growth data set is the length of the odontoblasts (teeth) in each of 10 guinea pigs at three Vitamin C dosage levels (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) with two delivery methods (orange juice or ascorbic acid).  
The file contains 60 observations of 3 variables  
- len : Tooth length  
- supp : Supplement type (VC or OJ)  
- dose : Dose in milligrams  

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
